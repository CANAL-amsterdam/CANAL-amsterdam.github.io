## Global Cultural Analytics

Cultural Analytics includes methods to explore and analyze cultural data, cultural agents, and cultural processes. Global Cultural Analytics aim for a global scope in terms of geography and type of data. 

Our research within this theme is focused on (1) Analyzing large cultural data sets, (2) Visualization of cultural collections and patterns, (3) applying AI to examine trends and patterns in large-scale collections.

- Applying computational methods to examine and visualize trends/patterns/outliers in cultural data sets
- A transnational/global perspective on data collections
- Development of methods for Global Cultural Analytics



## Modeling Complex, Dynamic Systems

The focus on computational methods surfaces the tension between quantitative and qualitative approaches in scholarship. Commonly, the humanities focuses more clearly on the qualitative aspects, whereas the quantitative approaches are reserved for the social sciences. However, with the increasing amount of cultural data and our reliance on AI systems to make sense of this data, the role of quantification again resurfaces. Common criticism on the use of quantification is that it is positivistic and reductionist, and thus it leaves out the complexity of culture.

Current AI systems also rely on categorization that reduce the complexity of the world considerably. In the sciences, theories and methods have been developed that address this complexity and set out to model this to learn about how dynamic social systems work. These methods have found there way into economics, the social sciences, and ecological sciences. In the jumanities, this is still in its infacy although attempts have been made in the past. However, these were often mainly theoretical, with the availability of data and computing power being a bottle-neck. These last two isses are of lesser concern noaways, which again raises the question to what extent we could translate these methods to deal with the core analytics challenges posed for this lab. This requires both the translation of theories of methods from complexity science to that of the humanities.[^2]


## Computational Visual Studies 

Over the last few decades, our world has become more visual. Many of these visual sources have been digitized and many more are created in a born-digital form. Visual Culture examines these sources. The focus is broad and encompasses the production, reception, intention, as well as economic, social, and ideological aspects. Visual Culture Studies is an interdisciplinary domain that approaches visual objects and visuality in culture from (art) history, media studies, and the social sciences.

The methodologies range from critical, hermeneutical of the visual to more formalized analysis of the content and distribution of images. AI can play an important part in these analyses. Ranging from the analysis of the images themselves, their distribution through media networks, and the power dimensions that determined their production, reception, and distribution. As such there is a clear link to Distant Viewing, which focuses on the automatic extraction of semantic elements of visual materials followed by the aggregation and visualization of these elements via techniques from exploratory data analysis, and Multimedia Analytics, which focuses on the development of AI-powered analytics techniques for exploring multimedia collections. Computational Visual Studies offers a theoretical and methodological framework that can integrate these fields of analysis.

Our research within this theme is aimed at (1) answering questions related to visual culture using AI and (2) developing AI technology/methods to answer these questions, (3) formalizing multimodal material for computational analysis. Access to training that is annotated in transparent ways that incorporate domain knwoledge allows for a more inclusive, and culturally-aware AI.
