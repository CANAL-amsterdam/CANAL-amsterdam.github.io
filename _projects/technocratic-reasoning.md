The project "Technocratic Reasoning in Dutch Parliamentary Debates" studies technocratic thought and argumentation in the Dutch Lower House. According to some studies, politics has become increasingly technocratic in recent decades. Unelected officials, scientific institutes and politicians void of ideology are merely "managing" society, instead of engaging in ideological politics. This project studies the complexities of technocracy as a form of thought and argumentation in parliament. Using computational methods, it seeks to uncover historical changes in the way members of parliament think and argue.
