CANAL is a partner of [Cultural AI](https://www.cultural-ai.nl/), a virtual research lab that is part of the [ICAI ecosystem](https://icai.ai/) (Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence).

Cultural AI is a lab for culturally valued AI that accelerates research on the intersection of humanities and artificial intelligence. Research areas have an equal focus on “humanities to improve AI research” as well as “AI to improve humanities research”. It mobilises national knowledge about cultural artefacts in our heritage collections and their use in AI application contexts. The full mission statement of the lab can be found [here](https://www.cultural-ai.nl/missionandvision).

CANAL's main area of interest is to collaborate on methodological approaches that can bridge the various case studies on applications of multimodal AI in the domain of heritage collections.
