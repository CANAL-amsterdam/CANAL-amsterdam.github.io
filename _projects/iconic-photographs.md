The focus of this project is on images as multimodal objects and the variety of meanings they can take on. Certain images may be uniquely famous and largely interpreted in a similar manner.
Yet, for other images the interpretation may change drastically depending on by who and in what context they are observed. Dealing with these complexities lies at the heart of this project.
