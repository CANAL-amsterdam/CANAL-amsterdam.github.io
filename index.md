Cultural factors impact how we interpret data. These factors can vary over time and place. Existing methods for cultural analytics, including AI, generally overlook these factors. The CANAL AI Lab aims to develop methods that are culturally-aware.

The research mission of CANAL is to co-develop and co-research culturally-aware AI methods from a critical/ethical perspective .

__Core analytical challenges__ include:

1. the analysis of multimodal individual cultural records that require context analysis to assess their mean
2. the analysis of dynamic developments in the content over time and across space;
3. a more inclusive and global approach to data.

__Three research Areas__
1. Global Cultural Analytics
2. Modeling Complex, Dynamics Systems
3. Computational Visual Studies
