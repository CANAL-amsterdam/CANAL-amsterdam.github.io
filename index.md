The CANAL lab is a cross-faculty lab at the University of Amsterdam with the research mission to co-develop and co-research culturally-aware AI methods from a critical/ethical perspective.

We believe that cultural factors impact how we interpret data. Importantly, these factors can vary over time and place and existing methods for cultural analytics, including AI, generally overlook these factors. With CANAL we aim to develop methods that are truly culturally-aware.
