On the 1st of September 2022 the CANAL AI lab was launched! CANAL is a cross-faculty lab at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), with the mission to co-develop and co-research culturally-aware artifical intelligence methods from a perspective that is both critical and ethical.

Within the lab, researchers will collaborate on projects surrounding three core [research themes](../../../../research_themes): global cultural analytics; modeling complex, dynamic systems; computational visual studies.

CANAL is based in Amsterdam at the [Bushuis](https://www.uva.nl/locaties/binnenstad/bushuis.html).
