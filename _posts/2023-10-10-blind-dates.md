Contributions based on the paper ['Blind Dates: Examining the Expression of Temporality in Historical Photographs'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06633) by CANAL members Alexandra Barancová, Melvin Wevers and Nanne van Noord have been accepted to two upcoming conferences: [Computational Humanities Research (CHR)](https://2023.computational-humanities-research.org/) and [CUDAN](https://cudan.tlu.ee/conference/). The study experiments with the task of 'dating' historical photographs using OpenCLIP, aiming to extend our understanding of the visual representation of time and its influence on image interpretation. This is situated within a broader goal of developing more temporally-aware computer vision and multimodal models.

CHR will be held on 6 – 9 December 2023 in Paris, France.

CUDAN will be held on 13 – 16 December 2023 in Tallinn, Estonia.
