On November 24, 2022, Tropenmuseum Amsterdam launched the annotation platform [Tag the Picture](https://tagthepicture.nl/home). This platform enables volunteers to enrich images in the colonial collection of the museum. In the future, the open-source platform will also be applied to different collection. During the launch, Melvin Wevers gave a short presentation that detailed how AI will be applied to data generated on this platform. Crowd-sourced annotations will be used to optimize image and object classification algorithm, to assess whether existing metadata is biased, and whether this metadata can be improved and further enriched.
